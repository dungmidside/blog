          At Tiki, my team is working in a huge application that use 2

          React 17. This make sure support for legacy system, but develop new
          component that need to serve both applications is a painfull task. It
          take double effort as normal component.

        <p>
          I build a new monorepo to build each application as isolated
          application, then inject to current application and load with a
          script. Now developer only to code one and add a small script for new
          and legacy application to make it work.
